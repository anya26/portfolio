<h1>CORE4 REFLECTION</h1>
<h2>Variable</h2>
	<p>A variable is a storage unit for a value that you define in the code you use.<br>
	An example of a variable in Python is:<br>
	t=Turtle()<br>
	<img src="variablescreenshot.PNG" alt="Variable" style="width:300px;height:200px;"><br>
	A real life analogy of a variable is the score in a sports game. The score starts at zero and as a point is made 
	(in any way that it is during the game), the score goes up by a certain amount. </p>
	
<h2>Conditionals</h2>
	<p>A conditional is a statement that performs different computations or actions 
	depending on whether the statement evaluates to true or false.<br>
	An example of a conditional in Python is:<br>
	if condition_1:<br>statement_block_1<br>elif condition_2:<br>statement_block_2<br>
	<img src="conditionalscreenshot.PNG" alt="Conditional" style="width:350px;height:200px;"><br>
	A real life analogy of a conditional is the legal drinking age. If you are under 21 you cannot legally consume alcohol, but if 
	you are older than 21, you can. </p>
	
<h2>Functions</h2>
	<p>A function is a procedure that is predefined that performs different computations or actions 
	using values you input.<br>
	An example of a function in Python is:<br>
	def Happy Birthday Anya():<br>print("Happy Birthday to you!")<br>
	<img src="functionscreenshot.PNG" alt="Function" style="width:400px;height:400px;"><br>
	A real life analogy of a function is seen in a car. When you are inside the car, you have options like accelterate or 
	steer in a certain direction that tell a car what to do. </p>

<h2>Loops</h2>
	<p>A loop is a sequence of instructions that are done until a certain condition is met.<br>
	An example of a loop in Python is:<br>
	for x in range(3):<br>t.forward(50)<br>t.right(360/sides)<br>
	<img src="loopsscreenshot.PNG" alt="Loop" style="width:400px;height:400px;"><br>
	A real life analogy of a loop is taking a test. Once you start a test you must keep answering questions until 
	time runs out or you finish all the questions. </p>
