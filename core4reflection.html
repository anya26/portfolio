<h1>CORE4 REFLECTION</h1>
<h2>Variable</h2>
	<p>A variable is a storage unit for a value that you define in the code you use.</p>
	<p>An example of a variable is:</p>
	<p>t=Turtle()</p>
	<img src="variablescreenshot.img" alt="Variable" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
	<p>A real life analogy of a variable is the score in a sports game. The score starts at zero and as a point is made (in any way that it is during the game), the score goes up by a certain amount. </p>
